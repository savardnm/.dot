# My .config
This is my .config repository, which stores my configuration files and useful setup guides. Based on the setup as described by [StreakyCobra](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754)

# Setup
to set up the configuration on a new computer, run the commands:

echo "source ~/.bashalias" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
